QTI battery charger binding

This binding describes the Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. battery charger device.
QTI battery charger gets and sets power supply properties by communicating with
charger firmware running on the remote subsystem (e.g. DSP) over PMIC Glink.

Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/soc/qcom/qcom,pmic-glink.txt for
information on "qcom,pmic_glink" device which is used in the example below.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "qcom,battery-charger"

- qcom,thermal-mitigation:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: Array of fast charge current limit values for different
		    system thermal mitigation levels. This should be a flat
		    array that denotes the maximum charging current (in uA) for
		    each thermal level. Elements should be defined in such a
		    way that the next element is always less than or equal to
		    the current element (descending order).

- qcom,wireless-fw-name:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: Firmware name that needs to be used for updating wireless
		    charger firmware.

- qcom,shutdown-voltage:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Battery voltage (in mV) when shutdown needs to be initiated
		    when battery SOC reaches 0 and device is not charging.
